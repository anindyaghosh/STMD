The apparent velocity results were binned irrespective of the apparent size
What's needed now is a 2-D binning with velocity and apparent size

This means re-running analysis scripts on Phoenix

##

*ProcessDroneVideo18_06_22.m was used to generate maxlocs

*DroneFootagePerf18_06_29.m was used to calculate number of successes

*AnalyseDroneSegments18_07_04.m was used to generate output figures

A) Key differences between desired conference version and previous are:
	A.1) Instead of the blur being defined in terms of photoreceptor spacing, define in pixels (DONE)
	A.2) Centre-surround kernel to have constant gain (DONE)
	A.3) Need to record the target response even if it's not one of the max locations (DONE)
	A.4) Run with parameters that were suitable for the 0.01 target mask threshold (DONE)
	A.5) Record the distribution of background values even in an approximate way (i.e. maybe 1000 bins with some constant threshold spacing, 0-0.01 to fall into a single bin). (DONE)
	A.6) Combination of light and dark channels (DONE)

B) Need to fix up the group sheet for one of the input videos as it had too many parts (DONE)
